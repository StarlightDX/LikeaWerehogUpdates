This uses current version naming, 1309/FISs35 is the update files for 1.3.9 FIS 3.6 or whatever comes after.
So basically 1309/FISs36 is the update host for the FIS 3.7 update files.
Then the server migrates to the next version, such as 1309/FISs36 for the FIS 3.7 next update host.
In other words the server version applies to the mod version it will apply to, i.e. both have parity and then the server advances the mod to the next server.
