## LAW:EF Definitive Edition Install.
Thank you for downloading Like a Werehog: Extreme Fury 1.3.10!
Due to GameBanana's file size restrictions, you will need to download the rest of the mod via an update.

The update is roughly 1GB in size.

The mod contents from 1.3.8 can still be enjoyed without updating, however you will need to update the mod to play the 1.3.10 content listed below:

- The Flooded City Entrance Field.
- The missions associated with the Entrance Field.
- All extra media introduced since 1.3.5.
- High quality GUI assets such as loading screens for stages, note this will not affect in-stage GUI.
- Future updates.

Alternatively you can download the mod in full from the Google Drive link on the mod page, which in some cases may be quicker.

Press the update button below to continue.
