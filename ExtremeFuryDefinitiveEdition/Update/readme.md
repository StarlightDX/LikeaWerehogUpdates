This uses current version naming, 1310 is the update files for 1.3.11 or whatever comes after.
So basically 1310 is the update host for the 1.3.11 update files or whatever update comes after 1.3.10.
Then the server migrates to the next version, such as 1311 for the 1.3.11 next update host.
In other words the server version applies to the mod version it will apply to, i.e. both have parity and then the server advances the mod to the next server.
